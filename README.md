# 1. Montecarlo Pi Estimation

This project explores the use of the Nano R4's Floating-Point Unit (FPU) through a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate Pi. Each time the button is pressed, the simulation starts. Once per second, new Pi digits are estimated and displayed on the screen, accompanied by a beep.

The Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical method used to estimate numerical results through random sampling. It's especially useful when a problem is too complex for analytical solutions â€” like estimating probabilities, integrals, or physical processes. Instead of solving a problem exactly, we simulate it many times using random numbers, and average the results.
